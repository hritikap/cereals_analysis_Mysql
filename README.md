#### Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/80-cereals
In this project a new Sql database called 'cerealsanalysis' is created and a csv data is taken from kaggle and is imported into the newly Created Sql database table with the help of sql workbench.

After importing the csv data into the sql table the database is loaded in the jupyter notebook using the commands below in line 1,2 and 3 and then analysis using sql commands is performed.

This database is very simple and is composed of very basic sql commands like select,alter,update etc inorder to answer simple queries
